Ecommerce Website For "Cherish Pretty Things" Boutique ,Currently being built on React.js for the frontend and Express/Nodejs on the backend.

The Backend is a major part of the project because the site will be controlled by an Admin with the following funtionalities.

- Creating New items for sale, requiring multiple images upload for a single item
- Deleting items from the shop
- Updating in the shop

MongoDb will also be used for data storage, and since lots of images will be displayed on the site, a cloud hosting service will be used to serve the images from a different server. Cloudinary is favoured.
